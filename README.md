# Project-1 Spotify lookup
Project 1 creates Music discovery app that uses Spotify API to dynamically fetch data form Spotify libraries to show top tracks of an Artist. The user will have option to pick an artist through a search bar on page. In case an artist is not picked the page will load top tracks for one of the three pre-selected artists.

  <summary><b>Platform</b></summary>
  <br>
  This project is primarily made on amazonsâ€™ AWS cloud9 service. Cloud9 is a cloud-based IDE that lets us write, run, and debug out code just with a browser. And because it is a cloud-based service it makes it easy for us share our work.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Frame work</b></summary>
  <br>
  For Project 1 we are using Flask framework. Flask is a web framework, that provide us with tools, libraries and technologies that allow us to build and setup a web application.

  <summary><b>Libraries</b></summary>

  ### Flask:
  ```python
  from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect
  ```
  * Render_template: Flask configures jinj2 template automatically using [grander_templete()](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/#flask.render_template) method.
  * request: request is used to make HTTP GET and POST requests
  * redirect: [redirect()](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/#flask.redirect) is used to redirect a user to different endpoint.

  ### Dotenv:
  ```python
  from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
  ```
  Dotenv library is going to be used for calling environment variables stored in `.env` file 
  * `load_dotenv` is use to load environment variable.
  * `find_dotenv()` can be used to find `.env` file

  ### Requests:
  ```python
  import requests
  ```

  Requests allows us to easily send HTTP requests.

  Example:
  ```python
  requests.post(tocken_url, data=tocken_data, headers=tocken_header)
  ```

  ### Base64:
  ```python
  import base64
  ```
  Base64 is used for RFC 3548 encoding, for URLs and HTTP POST requests.
  Example:
  ```python
  base64.b64encode(creds.encode())
  ```

  ### urllib.parse.urlencode:
  ```python
  from urllib.parse import urlencode
  ```
  [urllib.parse.urlencode()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlencode) is used for generating the query string of a URL or data for a POST request

## Bugs and Future improvments

### Bugs:

<details>
  <summary><b>Random HTML tags generated by Grammarly extension</b></summary>
  <br>
  
  **Bug:** Infinite loading when user try to access lyrics.
  
  **Reason:** Grammarly add-on automatically adds random tags in HTML, which intearfears with ```.innerHTML``` method in javascript causing some unexpected results.
  
  *example tags:*
  ```HTML
    <body data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded="14.995.0" data-gr-ext-installed="">
  ```
  ```HTML
    <div id="goog-gt-tt" class="skiptranslate" dir="ltr">
  ``` 
  ```HTML
    <font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></font>
  ```
  *This application uses ```.innerHTML``` method to fetch song and artist name from HTML text to pass in request URL for lyrics.* 
  
  *But due to above tags request URL looks like this:*
  ```web
  "GET /lyrics/%3Cfont%20style=%22vertical-align:%20inherit;%22%3E%3Cfont%20style=%22vertical-align:%20inherit;%22%3EButtabomma%20-%20Telugu%3C/font%3E%3C/font%3E/%3Cfont%20style=%22vertical-align:%20inherit;%22%3E%3Cfont%20style=%22vertical-align:%20inherit;%22%3ETop%2010%20tracks%20of%20Armaan%20Malik%3C/font%3E%3C/font%3E HTTP/1.1" 404 -
  ```
  
  *Instead of this:*
  ```web
  "GET /lyrics/Sau%20Aasmaan/Armaan%20Malik HTTP/1.1" 200
  ```
  
  **Current Fix:** 
  
  For now I am checking if the HTML file contain any of the tags added by Grammarly. And if a tag is found, the user gets alerted that the app may not work properly while Grammarly extension is active. And if the user tries to access lyrics window they get same alert again.

  <summary><b>Token API</b></summary>
  <br>
  
  **Bug:** Getting error message when calling Token API

  **Reason:** Token API requires base-64 encoded string in header for client credentials. I was just using ```.encode()```, which means I was encoding my sting with in bytes.

  **My fix:** use Base64 python library

  Before:
  ```python
  creds = f"{sptfy_id}:{sptfy_secret}"
  client_creds = creds.encode()
  ```

  After:
  ```python
  import base64

  creds = f"{sptfy_id}:{sptfy_secret}"    
  client_creds = base64.b64encode(creds.encode())
  ```
    
    
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Search API</b></summary>
  <br>

  **Bug:** Getting error message when calling Search API

  **Reason:** query parameter for the api was embaded in url instead of being sperated by -H. 

  *Expected API url looks like:*

  ```https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=tania%20bowra&type=artist" -H "Accept: application/json"```

  *Instead my url looked something like:*

  ```https://api.spotify.com/v1/search" -H "Data : tania bowra & type: artist" -H "Accept: application/json"```

  **My fix:** I used ```urllib.parse.urlencode()``` to convert query_param into query string for URL.

  So when I tried doing this:
  ```python
  query_param = {
            "q" : name,
            "type" : "artist",
            "limit" : "1"
        }
  response = requests.get(url_lookup, data=query_ param ,headers=request_header)
  ```
  I got an error message.

  To fix this, I used ```urllib.parse.urlencode()``` to convert query_param into query string
  ```python
  from urllib.parse import urlencode

  query_param = urlencode({
        "q" : name,
        "type" : "artist",
        "limit" : "1"
    })

    url_lookup = f"{url}?{query_param}"                             # creates a lookup url

    response = requests.get(url_lookup, headers=request_header) 
  ```
    
</details>
    
<details>
  <summary><b>Error page</b></summary>
  <br>

  **Bug:** Another problem I encountered was when I was implementing the search bar. Every time a bad input was made (e.g. Incorrect artist name or empty string name), the page will generate an error message.

  **Reason:** Search API will response with an error code instead of a JSON variable, when it gets bad input. So when the function tries to use .json() on the response, it     will cause an error. 
  
  **My Fix:**

  1. used try and except to catch an error. (If the response is not an error code, then the artist id is returned. Else, error code is returned)


  ```python
  try:    
      results = response.json()
      return results["artists"]["items"][0]["id"]
  except:
      results = response.status_code
      return results
  ```


  2. If an error code is passed, I returned an error message through the template, and the artist id is picked from the hardcoded list


  ```python
  if(isinstance(artist_id, int)):
    return render_template(
          "index.html",
          err_msg = True,                                     # error message
          len = len(song_info),                               # array length 
          len2 = len(song_info[0]),                           # array length for artists
          song_info = song_info,                              # array
          artist_name = spotify_api.get_artist(artist_id)     # gets artist's name
      )
  ```


  3. In HTML file, if an error message is passed, then display the error message


  ```HTML
  {%if err_msg%}
    <h style="font-size: 20px; color: red">No results found !!!</h>
  {%endif%}
  ```

### Future plan

1. Add few more styling elements to make webpage consistant across multiple browser.
