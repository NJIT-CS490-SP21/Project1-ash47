# Project-1 Spotify lookup
Project 1 creates Music discovery app that uses Spotify API to dynamically fetch data form Spotify libraries to show top tracks of an Artist. The user will have option to pick an artist through a search bar on page. In case an artist is not picked the page will load top tracks for one of the three pre-selected artists.

  <summary><b>Platform</b></summary>
  <br>
  This project is primarily made on amazonsâ€™ AWS cloud9 service. Cloud9 is a cloud-based IDE that lets us write, run, and debug out code just with a browser. And because it is a cloud-based service it makes it easy for us share our work.

  <summary><b>Frame work</b></summary>
  <br>
  For Project 1 we are using Flask framework. Flask is a web framework, that provide us with tools, libraries and technologies that allow us to build and setup a web application.

  <summary><b>Libraries</b></summary>

  ### Flask:
  ```python
  from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect
  ```
  * Render_template: Flask configures jinj2 template automatically using [grander_templete()](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/#flask.render_template) method.
  * request: request is used to make HTTP GET and POST requests
  * redirect: [redirect()](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/#flask.redirect) is used to redirect a user to different endpoint.

  ### Dotenv:
  ```python
  from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
  ```
  Dotenv library is going to be used for calling environment variables stored in `.env` file 
  * `load_dotenv` is use to load environment variable.
  * `find_dotenv()` can be used to find `.env` file

  ### Requests:
  ```python
  import requests
  ```

  Requests allows us to easily send HTTP requests.

  Example:
  ```python
  requests.post(tocken_url, data=tocken_data, headers=tocken_header)
  ```

  ### Base64:
  ```python
  import base64
  ```
  Base64 is used for RFC 3548 encoding, for URLs and HTTP POST requests.
  Example:
  ```python
  base64.b64encode(creds.encode())
  ```

  ### urllib.parse.urlencode:
  ```python
  from urllib.parse import urlencode
  ```
  [urllib.parse.urlencode()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlencode) is used for generating the query string of a URL or data for a POST request
